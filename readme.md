# Docker Helper Script
This is a simple script to check a systems status and its compatibility
with the Docker Engine, helps you set it up easily.

## Why use this script?
This script is designed to quickly startup your server environment with docker
instead of going through the process of going to read through and checking what
you need to start docker and run it. It uses dockers best practice on how to
install and uninstall docker.

## Support?
- Ubuntu
- Debian

## Functions:
- Checks the systems resources, RAM, Disk Space, Cores
- Checks if your OS is one of the supported operating systems
- Checks if Docker is installed.
- You can uninstall Docker completely using this script.
- You can install Docker using this script.

### Moving forward
- I will keep adding support for other operating systems such as Fedora, CentOS etc.
- Plus Docker Desktop as an option for GUI(gnome etc.)

### Note:
- You still need to know how docker works, this is just to help set it up.
- This script is not a replacement for the official docker documentation.
